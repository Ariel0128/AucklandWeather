Auckland Weather: temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed

The file “WeatherAuckland.csv” contains 428 observations (time points) from
weather data including temperature and relative humidity. 


The variable “forecast” provides the daily predictions based on specific
weather factors not involved with this data set. Investigate the extent to which
these forecasts are “accurate” based on ‘temperature’, ‘relative humidity’, ‘wind
direction’ and ‘wind speed’ using a Machine Learning (ML) approach. Note:
Don’t use regression modelling for this task. In other words, using ML (except
predictive modelling) e.g., PCA or Factor analysis, to “check” the daily forecasts
Propose an appropriate ML tool for this task, carry on the corresponding analysis
and present a critical analysis of the results.
